# Description
Using speech detection, face recognition and posture detection AI/ML modules, a IoT device that could give you a summary of the different movements that has been done throughout the day, tiny yet important metrics which could in the long run make a big difference in the wellbeing of a person? “POST” tries to do exactly that, a virtual assistant that every WFH person might not need, but something that they deserve. Hence the inspiration for naming the IoT Device as POST (Personal Office Space Tracker).
